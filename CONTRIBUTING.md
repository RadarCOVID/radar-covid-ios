# Contributing to radar-covid-ios

## I want to report a problem or ask a question

Before submitting a new GitHub issue, please make sure to

- Check out the README pages on [this repo](https://github.com/RadarCOVID/radar-covid-ios)
- Search for [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/RadarCOVID/radar-covid-ios/issues)

If the above doesn't help, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/RadarCOVID/radar-covid-ios/issues) on GitHub and provide information about your setup. If you feel like something is not working as it should, please provide the `log4j2`
debug output.

**Note**: If you want to report a regression (something that has worked before, but broke with a new release), please mark your issue title as such using `[Regression] Your title here`. This enables us to quickly detect and fix regressions.

## I want to contribute to RadarCOVID

Before you submit a new pull-request, please check the following few things:

- [ ] My pull-request is not just about code-style (if so please open an issue, where we can discuss about it).
- [ ] My pull-request does not introduce a plethora of new dependencies
- [ ] My pull-request introduces new features and/or fixes issues (please reference an issue if there exist one).
- [ ] If my pull-request changes tooling, I added some major arguments, on why this tooling is better.

## Why did my issue/PR get closed/unattended?

We are currently focused on national rollout. Hence, we try to keep the changes to a minimum and expect to take care of PRs in medium term. Please, be patience.

Proposed changes exclusively related to the tools we use should be thoroughly justified. We use a set of tools and configurations that we are used to. Therefore, unless strong arguments for changes are provided, we probably won't change it.

## Above All, Thanks for Your Contributions

Thank you for reading to the end, and for taking the time to contribute to the project! If you include the ðŸ”‘ emoji at the top of the body of your issue or pull request, we'll know that you've given this your full attention and are doing your best to help!
